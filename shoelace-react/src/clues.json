When he had almost gotten back to his room, he saw the first... thing. It made him think of a living blimp, floating gently. He slammed and locked he door to his room, but it passed through the wall, almost as though it weren't made of real stuff. For a few minutes, he sat paralyzed on the bed, watching things like the blimp float or mosey by. Then, right before Fink screamed, he saw something else - like a soap bubble but with claws for arms and what looked like tentacles. He'd have screamed too, if he weren't too scared to breathe. Its hideous teeth opened - Fink screamed and it moved through the wall into Fink's room instead. A moment later, it vanished.
