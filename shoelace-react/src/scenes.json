It takes Reassurance to convince Charlie that Viv won't name her as a source in print or go straight to Fuller with anything Charlie tells her. All she knows is she found Mr. Fuller at George's desk, looking over some of his schematics. The machine was there too, but no George. Fuller convinced her to help 'put it away' for safekeeping and said George must have forgotten when he left. That wasn't like George, but Charlie thought no harm would be done if they put it away at the shop. George had been worked up, after all - maybe he was frustrated.

Otherwise skip 'Getting Past the Guards.'", "Outside the building, the streetlights begin to fritz. Assuming Viv gets safely past any guards, a use of Locksmith gets her through the back door, into a darkened storage room in the rear of the shop. Through the door she can see a crack of flickering light. She hears a non-mechanical hum: an eerie sound that makes her think of sailors' descriptions of the song of whales.", "Viv can glance through the door long enough to see a figure tied to a chair and strange beings floating in the harsh spotlight around him. The strange beings appear blobby and luminescent, but alien and disturbing. If Viv neither brought Charlie with her and the scene 'Charlie Comes Clean' didn't occur immediately previous to this, she recognizes the figure in the chair as Charlie. In this case, players holding 'Soft Spot' take a \u22122 to either of the following Challenges. Otherwise, it's one of the job-seekers she has seen massed outside Fuller's. Just then, a swirling mass of translucent tentacles moves in from the edge of the spotlight. She may choose to look away and examine the 'Body in the Chair' afterward; to watch and face the test 'Watching the Devourer;' or to burst in and interrupt, in which case the action skips to 'They Came from Beyond.'

A wise player would have Viv look away, in which case she hears squishing, snapping, and a muffled scream. If Viv keeps watching, she sees a writhing, iridescent mass of tentacles and claws swarm over the body, which lets out a muffled scream before being devoured. The tentacles wrap it tight, and pincers begin snipping off pieces of flesh and passing them into a dark maw, eventually devouring the flesh and organs, leaving parts of a skeleton with ragged ends of muscle and tissue hanging off. The body's clothes, neatly snipped by the pincers, lie on the floor at its feet. Once the beast ceases feeding, Viv can sense it looking for its next prey - at which point it suddenly vanishes.", "If Viv brought company, they pass out as Viv undergoes either of the next two tests.

Otherwise, she can shake them back to a dazed consciousness and have them help her handle Fuller.", "Use the description of what happened to it to formulate an approximation of what she finds.", "Either way, if she examines the body and scrutinizes the seemingly empty warehouse, she must make the following test to 'Dodge the Chloroform.", "Whether he shouts it down from his darkened office with his hand on the switch that powers Preston's machine or mutters it while tied to the chair himself, Fuller can fill Viv in on the details of the situation. By now, she might be surprised to learn that he didn't kill George Preston, but he pushes the point, ignoring the collateral damage he has caused since.", "George Preston caused the first two deaths, Fink's and his own. The first was an accident. The light from Fink's room must have drawn the at- tention of the creature while it ignored Preston's lightless room. That night after work, with Charlie having slipped out, Preston broke down and con- fessed the whole thing to Fuller, begging the older man to destroy his device - but only after he let beasts from beyond kill him in the same way they had eaten Fink. To him, this seemed like the only way he could atone for Fink's death. Fuller didn't believe a word of it, instead thinking the kid had finally snapped from too many nights working late. Maybe he'd killed his neighbor, but nothing else made sense.", "Only after Fuller watched from his darkened office did he believe Preston's story. He threw the emergency switch to cut power to the kid's bench, but it was too late. Viv senses excitement, rather than horror in his voice. In Fuller's opinion Preston was a coward, afraid of his own success. If the world at the edge of our vision isn't made up of ghosts but of something much more horrible, that just makes his invention more valuable.", "All Fuller needs now are those damn schematics so he can reproduce the machine - as a weapon. With the news from Europe, he knows it'll be a seller's market soon enough and this could change things the way gas did in the Great War. And Charlie (if he killed or captured her)? He could tell it was only a matter of time before she went to the police - doesn't have the sense to keep her head down.", "The thing Viv saw? That isn't the only kind of beast out there, that's just his 'pet' - the one who's learned to come when Fuller switches on the device. He's seen far more than that: big, stupid, whale-like blobs and swarms of tiny creatures which pick over and devour the remains. You'd never know anyone had died. (Fuller isn't na\u00efve about his 'pet.' He switches off the machine once it loses interest in a body, only switching it on a few minutes later to attract the scavengers who remove the corpse. If the 'pet' can see beyond the light, Fuller doesn't want to find out firsthand.)", "Her head splitting, Viv comes back to full con- sciousness to find herself tied to a chair (with any companions beside her) on the main floor of the repair shop. Lights from the workbenches, meant to illuminate detail work, encircle her in a painful glare. She has difficulty making out any details be- hind the brightness. Once Fuller sees she's woken up, he monologues details from 'Fuller Fesses Up' above as he switches on the machine, triggering the test 'They Came from Beyond.'", "Though Viv gets a chance to escape, the ma- chine begins to take effect, revealing sights and sounds from a plane of reality bordering on our own. It takes some time for the creature to realize Fuller has set out a second meal. In the meantime, other strange beasts walk or float by Viv as she takes fights for Stability and takes stock of her situation.", "After either rushing in to save the captive in the chair, or being captured by Fuller and making the Stability Challenge 'They Came from Beyond' (whether Advance or Setback), Viv may attempt to escape without being eaten. She may use Quick Tests (Advance 4+, but any failed test increases the Difficulty of the next Quick Test of any kind by 1) as proposed by the player. If tied up by Fuller, she can use Athletics to untie her hands or Preparedness to have a pocketknife Fuller didn't think to check for. A successful Quick Test of Athletics or Fleeing, if Fuller has spotted her, gets her into the darkness where she can pull the plug to the machine, flip the wall switch to the desk, smash the machine, shoot it (the canonical method of destruction), or even propose a way to switch on the light in Fuller's office, turning the creature's attention to him. If she fails the tests and the Difficulty gets too high? Move on to the coda and Viv's last thoughts.", "How Viv resolves the situation if she escapes the creatures depends entirely on the player and her goals. She may wish to hold Fuller at gunpoint, if she has a gun, and force him to confess to his crimes. She may knock him cold or shoot him in the legs, and leave him for the police. She may prefer to rely on her two dice in Fleeing and try to grab any schematics (appropriate on whatever the GM considers a high success) as she escapes, calling in a tip for MacAdams to check out the repair shop."]}, "sadie_and_the_scoop": {"name": "Sadie and the Scoop", "scene_text": ["After wrapping things up at Fuller's, Viv can report back to Preston's fianc\u00e9e.
