scene_text(fullers_electrical_repair, "Several blocks north of Fulton, the main business street of downtown Brooklyn, Fuller's Electrical Repair occupies a two-story brick warehouse. Whether visiting Fuller or Fitzpatrick first, when Viv approaches Fuller's, she sees a small crowd of men waiting outside. Even in the city, work for electricians comes in piecemeal and more infrequently as the Depression worsens. A job with Fuller's guarantees a steady meal ticket. Once word got out that one of Fuller's employees has gone AWOL, several dozen men began lingering outside the shop in hopes of catching the big man's attention when he steps outside. If Viv stops to listen to the men talk, she learns that, the last few days, Fuller has asked one or two men to show him their skills. He must have high standards, however, as those men haven't come back.").

A small mezzanine office, accessible by iron staircase and walkway, sits on top of a storage room at the back. On the high-ceilinged main floor, a dozen men work at individual benches over an assortment of smaller items (radios, sewing machines, irons) and a few large appliances (refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, washing machines). Most don't look up, but one or two glance her way. If Viv asks about Charlie Fitzpatrick immediately, a nearby worker indicates a shorter, broad-shouldered figure in a cap working near the back of the room. Otherwise, Mr. Fuller's secretary, Petunia Adams, comes bustling forward to meet her. A well-scrubbed young woman of about 25 in a sensible cotton print frock, Petunia maintains an immaculate bun and an all-business attitude 'to keep the boys at bay.' She considers herself a kind of 'den mother' to the 'boys' in the shop, even those a decade older than herself.").

From the street, it looks like one of the storefront churches popping up in black communities throughout the city.

Heavy curtains block any view of the interior, although one can see the word Café in light relief despite someone's best attempts to scrape it off the windows.").

Rather than spend her hard-grifted money on the exotic robes and turbans favored by some mediums, she cultivates a simple aesthetic of black dresses accented by a heavy silver ankh necklace. When imparting wisdom, she speaks in what she'd call a 'resonant' voice, steeples her fingers, and stares at the supplicant from under her heavy brows.").
scene_text(temple_of_nephthys, "Though essentially a con artist, Madame has bought enough into her own shtick that she remains open to the existence of spirits: and if a machine really could do what George claims?

If so, Madame Isis senses 'a spirit floats about you, my dear, wishing to speak' (a guess on her part, but she's a great cold-reader) and invites her to participate in a 'Communion with the Dead,' held nightly. Communions start at 8 p.m. and last around two hours - longer if the spirits feel especially communicative. Otherwise, she indicates that if Viv has any further questions, perhaps she'd like to attend a 'communion' tonight.").

Cloyingly sweet incense fills the room from several braziers. Madame Isis begins the service by reading passages from the Book of the Dead. Some in the audience mutter, 'Amen,' probably from force of habit.").
scene_text(temple_of_nephthys, "Other than the reading, the séance consists of ordinary channeling. Should she have learned that Viv has lost someone, Madame passes on a 'message' telling Viv that this person has found peace in the afterlife but there's something they want Viv to do for them - but she can't make it out before losing the connection. 'Perhaps next time.' If Viv asks to contact the spirit of George Preston, Madame Isis stalls with some patter about not being able to sense George's spirit among them. Streetwise: Madame's reputation might survive channeling a living person to a few ordinary clients, but she never forgets Viv's profession and has no desire to end up on the wrong side of an exposé.").

The crowd of over a hundred thousand outpatients that flows in and out of the hospital daily provides her with some anonymity, although it thins out near the morgue.").

O'Connor in 'What the Cops Know,' she may persuade him to pull some strings with the police coroner, Phil Lenz, for her to get in and see the body.

scene_text(the_thing_in_the_morgue, "Whether or not Lenz shows her the body, the scene follows a similar course. Viv must first walk through a room of sheet-covered wooden dissection tables and instruments to get to the mortuary's cold chamber.

During the day, medical students bend over a few corpses on the tables, bone saws, scalpels, and forceps in hand. At night, Viv moves through chilly silence and shadow.").

The building's subterranean stone construction provides a certain natural coolness which is augmented by a loud industrial refrigeration system, but they only do so much to hide the odor of death.

Using Evidence Collection to check ankles and toes for identification, she soon notes the bodies lie in a rough chronological order. Fink - what remains of him - rests in a top bunk. To get a good view of the body at night, Viv may pull up a small- but-sturdy stepladder which provides attendants adequate balance to move hundreds of pounds. During the day, Lenz calls in a single medical student to wrest Fink down.").

The coroner closed Fink's staring eyes, but his mouth continues to gape in horror. Round, purpling bruises score his torso and one arm. In the center of each bruise, Viv sees a puncture wound over a small, hard lump. Several lumps have been excised for analysis, leaving gouges. Below his torso? A bag holds in what intestines remain and below that - nothing. The ends of his flesh appear ragged, as if torn off with an act of extreme force.").
scene_text(the_thing_in_the_morgue, "Evidence Collection: Either through talking to Lenz or by reading the autopsy notes, Viv learns that Fink died of a 'massive coronary event.' In lay terms, his heart gave out. The bruising and mutila- tion to his body occurred immediately after death, leaving venom directly under the skin instead of filtering into his bloodstream. Give the player time to connect this venom to the puncture-marks Viv saw in the center of the bruises. The venom's composition doesn't match any known species, but it most closely resembles that of jellyfish. The autopsy notes include several photographs of the bruising.

scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "Outside the building, the streetlights begin to fritz. Assuming Viv gets safely past any guards, a use of Locksmith gets her through the back door, into a darkened storage room in the rear of the shop. Through the door she can see a crack of flickering light. She hears a non-mechanical hum: an eerie sound that makes her think of sailors' descriptions of the song of whales.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "Viv can glance through the door long enough to see a figure tied to a chair and strange beings floating in the harsh spotlight around him. The strange beings appear blobby and luminescent, but alien and disturbing. If Viv neither brought Charlie with her and the scene 'Charlie Comes Clean' didn't occur immediately previous to this, she recognizes the figure in the chair as Charlie. In this case, players holding 'Soft Spot' take a −2 to either of the following Challenges. Otherwise, it's one of the job-seekers she has seen massed outside Fuller's. Just then, a swirling mass of translucent tentacles moves in from the edge of the spotlight. She may choose to look away and examine the 'Body in the Chair' afterward; to watch and face the test 'Watching the Devourer;' or to burst in and interrupt, in which case the action skips to 'They Came from Beyond.' Examining the corpse after 'Watching the Devourer' does not trigger the 'Body in the Chair' test.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "The action is over in a matter of horrifying moments. A wise player would have Viv look away, in which case she hears squishing, snapping, and a muffled scream. If Viv keeps watching, she sees a writhing, iridescent mass of tentacles and claws swarm over the body, which lets out a muffled scream before being devoured. The tentacles wrap it tight, and pincers begin snipping off pieces of flesh and passing them into a dark maw, eventually devouring the flesh and organs, leaving parts of a skeleton with ragged ends of muscle and tissue hanging off. The body's clothes, neatly snipped by the pincers, lie on the floor at its feet. Once the beast ceases feeding, Viv can sense it looking for its next prey - at which point it suddenly vanishes.").

By now, she might be surprised to learn that he didn't kill George Preston, but he pushes the point, ignoring the collateral damage he has caused since.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "George Preston caused the first two deaths, Fink's and his own. The first was an accident. The light from Fink's room must have drawn the at- tention of the creature while it ignored Preston's lightless room. That night after work, with Charlie having slipped out, Preston broke down and con- fessed the whole thing to Fuller, begging the older man to destroy his device - but only after he let beasts from beyond kill him in the same way they had eaten Fink. To him, this seemed like the only way he could atone for Fink's death. Fuller didn't believe a word of it, instead thinking the kid had finally snapped from too many nights working late. Maybe he'd killed his neighbor, but nothing else made sense.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "Only after Fuller watched from his darkened office did he believe Preston's story. He threw the emergency switch to cut power to the kid's bench, but it was too late. Viv senses excitement, rather than horror in his voice. In Fuller's opinion Preston was a coward, afraid of his own success. If the world at the edge of our vision isn't made up of ghosts but of something much more horrible, that just makes his invention more valuable.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "All Fuller needs now are those damn schematics so he can reproduce the machine - as a weapon. With the news from Europe, he knows it'll be a seller's market soon enough and this could change things the way gas did in the Great War. And Charlie (if he killed or captured her)? He could tell it was only a matter of time before she went to the police - doesn't have the sense to keep her head down.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "The thing Viv saw? That isn't the only kind of beast out there, that's just his 'pet' - the one who's learned to come when Fuller switches on the device. He's seen far more than that: big, stupid, whale-like blobs and swarms of tiny creatures which pick over and devour the remains. You'd never know anyone had died. (Fuller isn't naïve about his 'pet.' He switches off the machine once it loses interest in a body, only switching it on a few minutes later to attract the scavengers who remove the corpse. If the 'pet' can see beyond the light, Fuller doesn't want to find out firsthand.)").

Lights from the workbenches, meant to illuminate detail work, encircle her in a painful glare. She has difficulty making out any details be- hind the brightness. Once Fuller sees she's woken up, he monologues details from 'Fuller Fesses Up' above as he switches on the machine, triggering the test 'They Came from Beyond.'").

She may use Quick Tests (Advance 4+, but any failed test increases the Difficulty of the next Quick Test of any kind by 1) as proposed by the player. If tied up by Fuller, she can use Athletics to untie her hands or Preparedness to have a pocketknife Fuller didn't think to check for. A successful Quick Test of Athletics or Fleeing, if Fuller has spotted her, gets her into the darkness where she can pull the plug to the machine, flip the wall switch to the desk, smash the machine, shoot it (the canonical method of destruction), or even propose a way to switch on the light in Fuller's office, turning the creature's attention to him. If she fails the tests and the Difficulty gets too high? Move on to the coda and Viv's last thoughts.").
scene_text(breaking_into_fullers, "How Viv resolves the situation if she escapes the creatures depends entirely on the player and her goals. She may wish to hold Fuller at gunpoint, if she has a gun, and force him to confess to his crimes. She may knock him cold or shoot him in the legs, and leave him for the police. She may prefer to rely on her two dice in Fleeing and try to grab any schematics (appropriate on whatever the GM considers a high success) as she escapes, calling in a tip for MacAdams to check out the repair shop.").

The kindly, tweed-clad woman who taught her Natural Science course managed to make the subjects interesting but didn't woo her into the sciences. Viv had nearly forgotten her until she found herself in need of scientific assistance in one of her investigations. Viv admires Nettie's energy — as the new chair of the Department of Natural Sciences at Hunter College, she's always buried in paperwork, yet she always manages to teach the introductory classes and spend time meeting with students. The constant activity takes a toll, though, and there's no secret to the source of her energy: empty coffee cans litter Nettie's office and apartment. Viv may notice her friend's hands shaking from over-caffeination, or Nettie may suddenly exclaim that she'd entirely forgotten dinner; she made a cup of coffee at 4 p.m. so she could wait, then another at 6 , and now it's 9:30. From Nettie's point of view, Viv's investigations could benefit from a better application of the scientific method, and she's happy to teach it. Because her position keeps her out of the lab, she jumps at chances to answer Viv's questions, particularly if it gives her a chance to look at specimens or do some actual science. Nettie knows a lot about a particular field of science and a little about the rest. Consider assigning her a specialty and having her use her authority as chair to know the rest — by chance, she was just talking with Dr. McIntyre about the very thing Viv mentions, and can supply the broad outlines easily.").

Whether deciding to focus on sculpting or join the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, she's passionate about it — until she isn't. Despite her apparent religious frivolity, she never discards books the way she does beliefs and can be called upon for theological as well as occult questions. At night, her heavy kohl makeup, bangles, and robe-like dresses quickly identify her as an acolyte with aspirations. By day, she works as a low-level draftswoman in her father's architectural firm. In return, her father funds summer-long artists' retreats and tolerates her forays into occultism. He's waiting for her to give up her wild streak and put her obvious talent to use in the family trade. If you catch her in the studio, she's likely got paint, iron filings, or plaster in her tousled brown curls, depending on her current 'period.' Viv fell for Stella during an undercover investigation of a drug-smuggling ring passing itself off as a yogic sect. Even after their fling ended, Vivian stayed close with the vivacious bohemian, who will happily expound on current and former passions, or on architecture if she must. Stella's ebullient personality doesn't lend itself to limiting the flow of information, but her earnest, schoolchild's manner when explaining Mythos matters means that hearing about Cthulhu's eventual rise doesn't scare Viv as much as it might, coming from someone else.").

Now he hangs out his shingle as guide for amateur archaeological expeditions, which he leads to places such as Egypt, China, Peru, and the American Southwest. Between treks, Esteban provides curatorial guidance at the American Museum of Natural History. There, he specializes in pre-Columbian artifacts of Western, Central, and South America. With his free time, Esteban hikes the Long Trail in Vermont or blazes segments of New York's newly- proposed Long Path toward Albany. A man can never get too much fresh air, sunshine, or exercise. Esteban met Viv several years ago on an expedition he led for the National Geographic Society — he came for the archaeology, Viv for the story. They developed the friendship of kindred spirits who choose a never-ending quest for adventure over white picket fences or dinners at six-thirty sharp. When in the city, he enjoys dining out with Viv to share stories of their latest exploits. He's happy to hazard the cultural history of a peculiar idol she's discovered, or identify a strange set of tracks.").

source_description(louisa_reynolds, "Louisa Reynolds was born a Sinclair, third cousin to Vivian on a wealthier branch of the family tree: the kind of branch that keeps track of its third cousins. Inspired by stories of Florence Nightingale and Edith Cavell, she rejected a 'proper' lady's education and entered nursing school instead. When she married prominent psychologist Arthur Reynolds, everyone expected Louisa to retire from her hospital position and hold fundraisers for his sanitarium, join a few boards of charitable institutions, and finally start behaving like the Sinclair she was born to be. Instead, her husband hired her as the sanitarium's chief nurse and she used his library as a starting point for an extensive study of psychiatry. Ten years younger than her distant cousin, Viv first sought out Louisa while working on one of her first stories, investigating conditions at sanitariums and asylums around the city. She found Reynolds' methods refreshingly modern and humane (albeit from her 1930s perspective) and formed a friendship with the older Louisa. Now a stern, no-nonsense woman in her mid-40s, Louisa disapproves of the risks Viv takes in her work, but can't argue with the results. While neither a psychiatrist nor a doctor, she's absorbed a vast practical knowledge of medicine, pharmacy, and psychology through her work and self-education. If she doesn't have an answer for Viv, she consults her husband's library and matter-of-factly dispenses more information than Viv ever cared to know on a topic.").

Though by trade an electrician, I consider myself an inventor in the tradition of Marconi, Morse, and Bell. For several years now, I have worked on a device, which I consider a successor to the radio and the television. Just as we walk daily through waves from a dozen radio stations and now television stations as well, so I believe we are constantly surrounded by the unseen spirits who exist at a frequency most humans cannot perceive. From my readings on psychic phenomena, I conclude that mediums are no different from others who possess such acute hearing that they cannot live in a house with others or such a strong sense of taste that they only eat the blandest of foods. And we average men are like the color-blind who cannot distinguish red from green, only our numbers are far greater. Machines, unlike men, face no such limitations. When complete, my device will amplify light and sound to make visible that which exists at the very edge of what you and I can see and hear. From your books, I gather that you possess a greater openness to scientific proof of psychic phenomena than many others in your line of work. I would be deeply indebted if you would be willing to discuss my theory with me further and attend the first public unveiling of the device, which I now believe to be in its final stages. I have recently begun attending psychic ceremonies at the Temple of Nephthys. From my observation, I believe the medium, Madame Isis, possesses a true connection to the spirit world. Unlike others whose séances I have attended, she does not elicit phantasmal raps, conjure glowing hands, or move objects with ghostly fingers as a magician might. Several of her regular attenders with whom I have spoken, including her secretary, attest to the veracity of statements they receive from the departed. I consider such testimonies better proof than showy phenomena. Despite my faith in my own observations, I hope I might ask whether you had visited her on one of your investigations and, if so, whether you observed any fraudulent behavior of the types you describe in your books. I remain yours sincerely, George Preston").

investigative_ability(accounting, "Accounting", "You understand bookkeeping and accountancy procedures; you can read and keep financial records. You can: • tell legitimate businesses from criminal enterprises • reconstruct financial histories from old records (uncovering, say, slave-trading or smuggling) • spot the telltale signs of embezzlement, bribes, blackmail, or dummy companies • reel off the latest rumors from the world of business, finance and industry • track payments to their source", academic).

You can: • identify artifacts and rituals of living cultures • describe and predict the customs of a foreign group or local subculture • extrapolate the practices of an unknown culture from similar examples", academic).
investigative_ability(archaeology,"Archaeology","You excavate and study the structures and artifacts of historical cultures and civilizations. You can: • tell how long something has been buried and date its construction • identify artifacts by culture and usage • distinguish real artifacts from fakes • navigate inside ruins and catacombs, including finding secret doors and hidden construction • describe the customs of ancient or historical cultures • spot well-disguised graves and underground hiding places",academic).
investigative_ability(architecture,"Architecture","You know how buildings are designed and constructed. You can: • guess what lies around the corner while explor- ing an unknown structure • judge the relative strength of building materials • identify a building's age, architectural style, original use, and history of modifications • deduce the existence of hidden rooms, priest-holes, hyper-geometric witch-garrets, and other anomalies • construct stable makeshift structures • identify elements vital to a building's structural integrity • name the architectural firm responsible for any well-known building in your area, recounting any peculiarities involved in its construction",academic).
investigative_ability(art_history,"Art History","You're an expert on works of art (including the practical arts such as furniture and pottery) from an aesthetic and technical point of view. You can: • distinguish real works from fakes • tell when something has been retouched or altered • identify the age of an object by style and materials • accurately estimate the price of an objet d'art • call to mind historical details on artists and those around them • list the most recent films set in a given stylistic period and comment on their relative accuracy",academic).
investigative_ability(assess_honesty,"Assess Honesty","You can tell when someone's trying to play you for a sap. Not only does your gut tell you when a witness is lying, life's hard knocks have taught you to instinctively judge and sense motives and character. Not all lies are verbal. You can tell when a person is attempting to project a false impression through body language. Certain individuals - grifters, actors, professional gamblers, and similar - may be so adept at lying that they never set off your built-in lie detector, or overload it by being 'always on.' Some people believe their own falsehoods. Psychopathic and sociopathic personality types (like most sorcerers and/or politicians) and brainwashed cultists lie reflexively and without shame, depriving you of the telltale tics and gestures you use to sense when a person is deceiving you. Those who have communed excessively with the inhuman intelligences of the Mythos will occasionally 'read wrong,' but will similarly fail to send any useful signals to a sane watcher. Though you may know it to be false, utter hokum the speaker believes does not register as untruthful - just absurd. Use Assess Honesty to cold-read a mark for fortune-telling scams, phony séances or mentalist acts, and the like.",interpersonal).
investigative_ability(astronomy,"Astronomy","You study celestial objects, including the stars and planets. You can: • decipher astrological texts • use a telescope, including large reflectors • plot the movement of stars and planets, and know which ones are overhead at any given time • predict eclipses, comets, meteor showers, and other regular astronomical phenomena An L.A. Investigator with this ability enjoys research access to the Griffith Park Observatory.",technical).
investigative_ability(bargain,"Bargain","You are an expert in making deals with others, convincing them that the best arrangement for you is also the best for them. You can: • haggle for goods and services • gauge likely prices of items, including what someone else will pay for them • mediate hostage situations or diplomatic crises • swap favors or information with others • exchange cash for information Spends allow you to gain an advantage other than information in exchange for money or other considerations.",interpersonal).
investigative_ability(biology,"Biology","You study the evolution, behavior, and physical makeup of living organisms. You can: • tell when an animal is behaving strangely • tell whether an animal or plant is natural to a given area • identify an animal from samples of its hair, blood, bones, or other tissue • analyze unknown ichor, scales, or slime • identify a plant from a small sample • isolate or detect natural poisons or venoms",academic).
investigative_ability(bureaucracy,"Bureaucracy","You expertly navigate bureaucratic organization, from government offices to large private firms. From the hidden reasons behind a bureaucracy's opaque decisions to the arcane details of its paperwork, you can extract the information you seek smoothly and with a minimum of ruffled feathers. You can: • convince officials to provide sensitive information • gain credentials on false pretenses • find the person who really knows what's going on • develop and maintain contacts within a bureaucracy with which you have regular dealings • locate offices and files • borrow equipment or supplies In a noir setting you also know which government officials are honest and which are corrupt. In the latter case, you may know who's lining their pockets or is holding something over them. The same goes for members of private institutions. Bureaucracy is not a catch-all information- gathering ability. Bureaucrats wish to convey the impression that they are busy and harried, whether or not they actually are. Most take a profound, secret joy in directing inquiries elsewhere. When players attempt to use Bureaucracy to gain information that is more easily accessible via other abilities (such as Research), their contacts will snidely advise them to do their own damn legwork.",interpersonal).
investigative_ability(chemistry,"Chemistry","You're trained in the analysis of chemical sub- stances. Given lab facilities, you can: • identify drugs, pharmaceuticals, toxins, and viruses, among a wide variety of other materials • create simple explosives, poisons, gases, and acids • analyze unknown substances, alloys, compounds, etc. • perform ballistics and gunpowder analysis of bullets or other evidence • match samples of dirt or vegetation from a piece of evidence to a scene • perform chemical document analysis on ink or paper",technical).
investigative_ability(cop_talk,"Cop Talk","Despite the low regard in which cops hold private detectives, you know their lingo and needs well enough to extract information from them. You can: • prompt them to spill confidential information • get excused for minor infractions • read between the lines when a cop can't come out and tell you the whole truth • call in favors from law enforcement contacts - often the one cop on the force who genuinely likes and trusts you",interpersonal).
investigative_ability(craft,"Craft","You can create useful physical objects, working with materials like wood, metal, precious stones, leather, and so forth. This allows you a general background knowledge in handmade items of all kinds. You can: • discover a secret drawer in a wooden desk • tell roughly how old a craft object is • identify its famous maker, if applicable • sort fakes from authentic items • say whether an item was skillfully or crudely fashioned • know what kind of wood, stone, porcelain and so on an item is made of • in the case of gems and precious metals, tell whether the materials are genuine",technical).
investigative_ability(cryptography,"Cryptography","You can make or break codes and ciphers in any language you can read. Given some time and a dictionary, you may be able to puzzle out foreign alphabets, translating languages by brute force.",academic).
investigative_ability(cthulhu_mythos,"Cthulhu Mythos","You have begun to piece together the secret rules of the real world, rather than the ignorant scrim of physics and religion. You recognize the great names, and the truths they conceal. Have you read a Mythos tome, a rare, ancient book laying out in obscure detail the maddening secrets of Cthulhu and the Old Ones? This ability lets you recall any specific hints or facts from it relevant to your current situation. You can: • identify inhuman creatures and their spoor • translate pre-human tongues • read inscriptions of the far-distant past • predict what comes next when watching cult- ists perform an obscene rite • identify which alien god has incarnated itself inside the formless monster that is currently crushing the life out of you • distinguish a practitioner of an ordinary, ineffectual human occult tradition from a sorcerer able to call on the power of the Old Ones. Setbacks while using this ability may leave you with Mythos Shock Problem cards.",academic).
investigative_ability(evidence_collection,"Evidence Collection","You're adept at casing an investigation site and at finding important clues. You can: • spot hidden objects or objects of interest (such as bullet casings under a couch, or drops of blue ooze behind a desk) at a crime scene or other investigation site • note relationships between objects at a crime scene, reconstructing sequences of events • find, transfer, take, and compare fingerprints • match typewritten materials to a given machine • match handwriting to a known sample • store objects for forensic analysis without contaminating your samples",technical).
investigative_ability(flattery,"Flattery","You get people to help you by complimenting or playing up to them, as subtly or blatantly as they prefer. You can get them to: • reveal information • perform minor favors • regard you as trustworthy • date you (if applicable)",interpersonal).
investigative_ability(forensics,"Forensics","You study crime scenes and perform autopsies on deceased subjects to determine their cause and circumstances of death. You can use skeletal evidence to reconstruct the physical details (age, sex, medical condition, sometimes occupation) of the deceased. In the case of death by foul play, your examination can identify: • the nature of the weapon or weapons used • the approximate time of death • the presence of intoxicants or other foreign substances in the bloodstream or on the skin • the contents of the victim's last meal In many cases, you can reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the victim's death from the arrangement of wounds on the body. Though forensic science really only takes off in the postwar era, you can still lift and match fingerprints, make casts of tire tracks, and perform basic ballistics tests.",technical).
investigative_ability(geology,"Geology","As an expert on rocks, soils, minerals, and the primordial history of the Earth, you can: • analyze soil samples, crystals, minerals, and so forth • determine the age of a rock stratum • date and identify fossils • evaluate soil for agriculture or industry • identify promising sites for oil or water wells, mines, etc. • anticipate vulcanism, seismic events, avalanches, and other earth phenomena",academic).
investigative_ability(history,"History","A broad study of recorded human history, with an emphasis on political, military, economic, and technological developments, allows you to: • recognize obscure historical allusions • recall important or relevant events in a given country, city, or region • identify ancient languages and scripts (assuming they're of human origin) • perform textual analysis on a manuscript or book to date it or identify the author • determine the age of a document • tell where and when an object made during historical times was fashioned • identify the period of an article of dress or costume • (if based in L.A.) name Hollywood productions set in a particular historical period, supplemented with a list of their ludicrous inaccuracies",academic).
investigative_ability(inspiration,"Inspiration","You can convince reluctant witnesses to supply information by appealing to their better selves. After a few moments of interaction, you intuitively sense the positive values they hold dearest, then invoke them in a brief but stirring speech. Depend- ing on the person you're dealing with, you might call to mind their: • religious beliefs • love of friends, family, or community • sense of fairness • desire for justice • belief in a secular ideology, whether it be democracy, Marxism, or pacifism • pride in personal achievement",interpersonal).
investigative_ability(intimidation,"Intimidation","You get what you want from people by scaring them - physically, or with vividly detailed threats. You can: • gain information • inspire the subject to leave the area • quell a subject's desire to attempt violence against you or others • extract promises of future cooperation, secured by the threat of your later retaliation",interpersonal).
investigative_ability(languages,"Languages","Allows you to extract information from documents written in languages other than English. You may not be able to elegantly translate or win points for accuracy among true academics, but you find the clue you need. A scenario writer who cares about realism will not require your P.I. to explain his expertise in more than one unlikely tongue per case. Especially with obscure languages, this ability likely requires the use of an English-to- whatever-language-matters-here dictionary and some extended brow-furrowing.",academic).
investigative_ability(law,"Law","You are familiar with the criminal and civil laws that pertain in your noir city, as well as on the state and federal levels. You can bluff your way through dealings with foreign legal systems. With this knowledge you can: • assess the legal risks attendant on any course of action • understand lawyerly jargon • call on legal colleagues or contacts for favors and advice • convincingly dispute the legality of actions undertaken by police and prosecutors",academic).
investigative_ability(locksmith,"Locksmith","You can open doors and locks, and disarm alarms, without benefit of a key. Or maybe you have some universal passkeys with you. You can also find convenient windows to jimmy or coal-cellar doors to force, if need be. Many locks require specialized tools, possession of which without a locksmith's license is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. Fortunately, your P.I.'s badge allows you to carry them. Very complex or tricky locks may require spends to open them speedily, to avoid noise or damage, or to relock afterward. Using Locksmith is, in other words, a way to gather clues. A lock that won't open is like a witness that won't talk or a bloodstain you can't find: antithetical to the mystery-solving, investigative-adventure design goals of GUMSHOE and Cthulhu Confidential. Opening a safe, bank vault, or other lock for a benefit other than information-gathering requires a Filch Challenge. You are presumed to be using your knowledge of locks as part of that attempt.",technical).
investigative_ability(medicine,"Medicine","You can diagnose human disease, injuries, poisonings, and physical frailties, and may be broadly acquainted with veterinary medicine as well. If past medical training makes sense as part of your backstory, you may still hold a medical license. You can: • diagnose diseases, poisonings, and other ailments • prescribe remedies for a treatable condition • deliver a baby • identify the extent and cause of an unconscious person's trauma • detect when a person is suffering from a physically debilitating condition such as drug addiction, pregnancy, or malnutrition • establish a person's general level of health • identify medical abnormalities • understand medical jargon",academic).
investigative_ability(occult,"Occult","You're an expert in the historical study of magic, superstition, and sorcery from the Stone Age to the present. From Theosophists to Voodoo to the Golden Dawn, you know the dates, the places, the controversies, and the legends. You can: • identify the cultural traditions informing a ritual by examining its physical remnants • supply historical facts and anecdotes concerning various occult traditions, demons, and legends • guess the intended effect of a ritual from its physical traces • identify occult activities as the work of informed practitioners or dilettante thrill-seekers • fake a fortune-telling session, séance, or other occult activity • read and cast a horoscope • identify occult paraphernalia, grimoires, symbols, and codes This ability does not allow you to work magic or summon supernatural entities. It grants only the most superficial hints about the Cthulhu Mythos. You may or may not believe that real supernatural entities and forces exist: the skill functions just as well in either case.",academic).
investigative_ability(oral_history,"Oral History","You can find sources willing to talk, win their confi- dence, and gather (usually lengthy) oral testimony about historical events, local traditions, folklore, family legend, or gossip. This is an excellent way to do research in illiterate or semi-literate societies, and in rural or small-town communities in general. This ability also covers taking shorthand notes or making recordings without spooking your sources.",interpersonal).
investigative_ability(outdoorsman,"Outdoorsman","Long hours of camping and exploration in the wild have made it as comfortable to you as life in the concrete jungle. You can: • tell when an animal is behaving strangely • tell whether an animal or plant is natural to a given area • find edible plants, hunt, and fish • make fire and survive outdoors at night or in bad weather • navigate overland, albeit more easily with a compass and a map • track people, animals, or vehicles across grass or through forests • hunt with dogs, including tracking with bloodhounds, assuming you have friendly dogs available Despite the period gender specificity of the term, nothing stops female characters from having this ability.",technical).
investigative_ability(pharmacy,"Pharmacy","You are able to identify and compound drugs and medicines. You can: • identify drugs and potions, and recognize their side-effects and contraindications • identify poisons and determine antidotes • secure or manufacture morphine, cocaine, and other controlled substances",technical).
investigative_ability(photography,"Photography","You're proficient in the use of cameras, including still and motion-picture photography. You can: • take useful visual records of crime scenes or expeditions • develop film or plates and enhance hidden details • use filters and lights to capture images only vis- ible in infrared or ultraviolet • spot manual retouching or camera trickery in a photographic image or negative • take trick photographs using double exposures and other methods • realistically retouch and manipulate photographic images • (Los Angeles) put cinematographers at ease by talking shop with them about the latest equipment • (Los Angeles) look at a movie or professionally taken still photo and identify the studio employee who lensed it",technical).
investigative_ability(physics,"Physics","You study the fundamental forces of the universe: pressure, electromagnetism, motion, gravity, op- tics, and radioactivity. You can: • design or refit experimental machinery to test, detect, or manipulate physical forces and energies • obtain and operate expensive or obscure pieces of laboratory equipment such as Crookes tubes, Geiger counters, or magnetometers • understand and apply advanced mathematics, including non-Euclidean geometries • (perhaps) understand advanced or alien technologies",academic).
investigative_ability(psychology,"Psychology","Your familiarity with the latest in the burgeoning field of human psychology grants you insight into the criminal mind. Based solely on their known modus operandi, you can make accurate guesses as to the upbringing and pathology of unidentified criminals. You can: • predict their upcoming actions based on their past behavior • distinguish an individual whose violence is deemed acceptable by his home culture from one who consciously defies cultural norms • distinguish subjects who can be successfully rehabilitated from the incorrigibly violent or deviant • tell whether a known individual's criminal behavior is in response to deep psychological impulses, or is driven primarily by greed",interpersonal).
investigative_ability(reassurance,"Reassurance","You can get people to do what you want by putting them at ease. This may involve fast talk, genuine sympathy, a rational accounting of risks, or just a calming presence. You can: • elicit information and minor favors • allay fear or panic in others • instill a sense of calm during a crisis • gain trust • present yourself as someone who successfully follows through on promises",interpersonal).
investigative_ability(research,"Research","You can ferret out information from collections of books, records, files, archives, newspaper morgues, or big piles of unsorted telegrams and correspondence. If the information lies within, and you have access to the collection, you can find it. You can also determine patterns: who wrote about what and to whom, what kinds of books an eccentric collector values, what might be missing from the official files, which records seem doctored and by whom, and so forth.",academic).
investigative_ability(streetwise,"Streetwise","You know how to behave among crooks, gangsters, dopers, hookers, grifters, and other habitués of the criminal underworld. You can: • use criminal etiquette to avoid fights and conflicts • identify unsafe locations and dangerous people • make and utilize criminal contacts - fences, black marketeers, drug dealers, gun runners, and so forth • successfully price illegal goods such as drugs, stolen items, or weapons • gather underworld rumors • identify your city's gangland players and understand their power relationships, even if these have recently changed",interpersonal).
investigative_ability(theology,"Theology","You study human religions in their various forms, both ancient and modern. You can: • supply information about religious practices and beliefs • quote relevant passages from the major scriptures • recognize the names and attributes of various saints, gods, and other figures of religious wor- ship and veneration • identify whether a given religious practice or ritual is orthodox or heretical • fake (or in some traditions, officiate at) a religious ceremony • know the prominent faiths and religious figures of your noir city - for example, the many wild new cults of the L.A. basin This ability does not allow you to work miracles, banish demons, commune with deities, or otherwise invoke supernatural power, even if the campaign admits the existence of a non-Mythos God or gods. You may believe in a given religion or not; the skill functions just as well in either case.",academic).

In odd instances where finding the item grants you an advantage other than information - let's say locating the small Mauser in the false compartment just as Horgan's torpedoes come through the door - use a Conceal Challenge.",manual).
general_ability(cool,"Cool","Measures your ability to make the smart play, instead of the impulsive one, in response to emotional temptation. Cool saves you from such standard errors of the private dick game as: • falling for the wrong kind of dame • showing a tell that warns the killer that you know he did it • smart-mouthing the cop who's itching to club you • hitting the roulette wheel when you know you shouldn't • attempting a futile grand gesture to wring real justice from a rigged system • resist supernatural forces attempting to influence your behavior",mental).
general_ability(devices,"Devices","You build, repair, and operate electrical or mechanical devices. And what you can put together, you can take apart, disabling equipment either unnoticeably or completely. You know the workings of electrical devices from simple alarm systems to the most advanced radios. You can also hot-wire a car with an electrical ignition, which is most of those built since 1920. Given the right components, you can create jury-rigged devices from odd bits of scrap. This expertise also encompasses machines from simple stick traps to the most complex adding machines or steam turbines. (With the exception of simple latches; working with locks is covered by the Locksmith ability). Given the right components, you can create jury-rigged devices and booby-traps from odd bits of scrap. This doubles as an Investigative Ability when used to: • determine the function of a given piece of equipment • evaluate the quality of workmanship used to create an item • make high-quality audio recordings on records, Dictaphone cylinders, or wire • read Morse Code • tap telephone or telegraph lines • use a device in good repair as intended Once per case, you may specify that you can operate and (where relevant) drive a new type of heavy machinery, such as: back-hoe, steam roller, construction crane, or steam shovel. Your GM may ask you to supply a line of dialogue explaining where you picked this up.",manual).
general_ability(disguise,"Disguise","You can become someone else: clothes, voice, mannerisms, and posture. You can: • impersonate someone on the phone • blend into a crowd in the street • mingle at a party with those outside your social station • hold an entire conversation with an unwitting friend or suspect Expect to have to beat a high number in order to Advance while impersonating a real person to their friends or acquaintances. Depending on the situation, impersonating a plausible and even fictitious stranger ('oh, I'm his cousin from upstate New York') to people one has never met might require only a Difficulty 4 Quick Test.",manual).
general_ability(driving,"Driving","Anyone who's been taught can drive a car down the road without this ability. You, on the other hand, are a skilled defensive driver, capable of wringing high performance from even the most recalcitrant automobile, pickup truck, or bus. You can: • evade or conduct pursuit • avoid collisions, or minimize damage from collisions • navigate, read maps, and maintain a sense of direction The ability assumes you can drive cars, trucks, motorcycles and small motor boats. Once per case, you may reveal that you can drive another type of vehicle requiring specialized training, such as a bus, yacht, plane, tank, or gyrocopter. Where this seems unlikely, the GM may invite you to improvise a line describing the circumstances under which you learned this.",manual).
general_ability(explosives,"Explosives","As an expert in bombs and booby-traps, you can: • defuse bombs and traps • handle nitroglycerin or other dangerously unstable materials with relative safety • given time, blow open safes or vaults without damaging the contents • mix explosive compounds from common chemicals • safely construct and detonate explosive devices or booby-traps of your own Explosives doubles as an Investigative Ability when used to: • figure out the configuration of a bomb from its blast effect and shrapnel • for any bomb (exploded or unexploded), determine the method and materials of the bomb-maker, and deduce his sophistication, background, and skill",manual).
general_ability(filch,"Filch","Your nimble fingers allow you to unobtrusively manipulate small objects. You can: • pilfer clues from (or plant clues at) a crime scene under the very noses of unsuspecting authorities • pick pockets • plant objects on unsuspecting subjects",manual).
general_ability(first_aid,"First Aid","You can perform first aid on sick or injured individuals, including yourself. Depending on how the GM structures the Challenge, an Advance or Hold might stabilize the patient, keep him alive just long enough to hear a whispered confession, or fix him up entirely. Injuries the GM describes as relatively minor will be easier to score Advances and Holds on than ones he describes as serious or life-threatening.",manual).
general_ability(fleeing,"Fleeing","This ability governs how speedily you run away from impending danger, whether it comes from a gambler's gun, cops intent on locking you up, or a formless entity from beyond space. Used for characters who aren't otherwise Athletic, to give them some chance of avoiding physical harm. If you don't have Fleeing, because you instead use the better, all-around ability of Athletics, such Challenges instead default to Athletics.",physical).
general_ability(hypnosis,"Hypnosis","You can hypnotize a willing subject, recovering lost memories, suppressing unwanted ones, or removing destructive compulsions. Your technique likely involves the use of narcosynthesis, in which you administer a small dose of sodium pentothal to your subject. Treat as an Investigative Ability when gaining information useful to your case. The Investigator may submit to narcosynthesis under a supporting character's care in hopes of Countering Mythos Shocks.",mental).
general_ability(magic,"Magic","Your GM may decide that his version of Cthulhu Confidential allows the Investigator to eventually learn and practice efficacious magic. This might be used to summon Mythos entities, or bind them once summoned (a crucial step, yet all too often overlooked!). A few spells allow sorcerers to harm their opponents directly, or to subject them to mental influence. Use Athletics to resist the former, and Cool for the latter. If your Magic dice exceed your dice in the ability used to resist magic, use Magic instead. (To my taste, giving a noir detective sorcerous powers veers too far from noir horror into the tongue-in-cheek urban fantasy of the film Cast a Deadly Spell. But once you start playing, it's your game, not mine, so if that's what you want, do it).",mental).
general_ability(preparedness,"Preparedness","You expertly anticipate the needs of any investigation by packing a kit efficiently arranged with necessary gear. Assuming you have immediate access to it, you may be able to produce an object needed to overcome an impediment to your progress. A Quick Test simply determines whether you have the item in question. A Challenge allows you to not only have the object, but also overcome an associated obstacle. Equipment standard to the private investigation racket does not require a test. This includes but are not limited to: notebooks or paper, writing implements and ink, flashlights, candles and matches, colored chalk, pen-knives, magnifying glasses, pocket mirrors, string, sandwiches, and a flask of middling whiskey. Other abilities imply the possession of basic gear suitable to their core tasks. Characters with First Aid or Medicine have their own first aid kits or medical bags; Photographers arrive on the scene with cameras, film, and flash bulbs. Narrative credibility constrains the sorts of items you might have brought with you. If the GM determines that your possession of an item would seem ludicrous, anachronistic, or out of genre, you don't get to test for it. You simply don't have it. When in doubt as to allow an item, the GM imagines the film version of your adventure. If the detective's suddenly having the desired object on hand without prior setup would earn a derisive laugh from moviegoers, the GM disallows the attempt.",manual).
general_ability(psychoanalysis,"Psychoanalysis","You can provide comfort, perspective, and solace to the mentally troubled. You may be a Freudian alienist, a priest or pastor, or just an empathetic and intuitive individual. Unlike Reassurance spends, your counsel can aid supporting characters mentally scorched by confrontation with the Mythos. You can't use your own Psychoanalysis ability to counter your own Mythos Shocks.",mental).
general_ability(sense_trouble,"Sense Trouble","This ability allows you to perceive (either with sight or other senses) potential hazards to yourself or others. For example, you can: • hear the splash of a Deep One dropping into the sewer behind you • see a flittering shape cross the moon • have a bad feeling about that eerily hunchbacked priest at the seemingly deserted cathedral • notice that those two palookas in the dark corner of the bar have been intently watching you all night long • realize that anyone up in that lighthouse will have seen you coming a mile away You always make Sense Trouble Challenges, even if you get a Hold or Setback and have to play your character as unaware of impending trouble. GMs should never require the use of this General Ability to find clues to the mystery at hand. Instead, use Investigative Abilities, defaulting to Evidence Collection when no ability seems more appropriate. Sense Trouble applies during a scenario's action and suspense sequences. In short, if not seeing something will get you attacked or confront you with some other practical ill- consequence, it's Sense Trouble.",mental).
general_ability(shadowing,"Shadowing","You follow suspects without revealing your presence. You can: • use binoculars or telescopes to keep watch on a target from a distance • find undetectable vantage points • hide in plain sight • anticipate blind spots in your coverage and plan for them, or use them to lose your own shadowers",physical).
general_ability(stability,"Stability","Remain in control of your thoughts and actions when confronted with frightening or traumatic sights, sounds, or other sensory input. Stability allows you to: • move toward danger a self-protective person would avoid • avoid or suppress physical symptoms of terror and disgust, from nausea to adrenaline rush • appear calm to others, even when terrified inside • file a weird sight deep in your memory, keeping your mind intact by refusing to entertain its true significance Encounters with the especially destabilizing forces and entities of the Mythos may leave you with a Mythos Shock Problem. If you fail to counter it during play, you may suffer a mental breakdown during the story's denouement.",mental).
general_ability(stealth,"Stealth","You're good at moving (and standing still) without being noticed. You can: • move silently • hide in shadows or cover • evade visual security, whether guards (usual) or cameras (unusual) • listen at doors or windows without being overheard yourself Use Stealth when you are creeping around unnoticed. If you are trying to lose a pursuer, use Shadowing. Outrunning a pursuer is Athletics or Fleeing.",physical).
